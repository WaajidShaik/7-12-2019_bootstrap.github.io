        Remember how easy it was to have fun? All you needed was a bit of space, maybe a ball and before you knew it, you and the kid next door became best friends. Somewhere between work, traffic, malls and smartphones, the city has forgotten the joy of playing. We didn’t. And, honestly, we missed it. That’s why we started Play: a space where you can do just that and in the process, make new friends, play new games, find new adventures — and have some fun while you’re at it
